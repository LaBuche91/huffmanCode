# huffmanCode
Huffman Coding Project:

This project consists of encoding a .txt file using an algorithm that generates a Huffman tree.
All the comments in the code are in french.
This tree defines the binary codes of each character according to their number of occurrences.
Thus by creating this tree, the project will generate a Huffman coding of the file in binary and will also be able to decode it.
Huffman coding allows for better text file compression ratios.

This project requires a platform that can run java.

When you run this project a menu offering several features will appear.

Features:
1-generate and display the encoding of a .txt file by creating a Hufmman tree.  
2-display the Huffman tree created in the previous feature (therefore requires having already executed the 1st feature).  
3-display the characters of the file and their binary codes generated thanks to the Huffman tree (therefore requires having already executed the 1st feature).  
4-decode the code generated thanks to the Huffman tree created previously (therefore requires having already executed the 1st feature).  
  
I couldn't find the character code of a newline in java for feature number 1 and 2.  
Therefore, when a newline is displayed, it will be represented as a newline in the terminal.
